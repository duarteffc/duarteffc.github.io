title: Introduction

My name is Duarte Frazão Costa and I'm based in Porto, Portugal. 

I've been doing software development, professionaly, since 2016, although I started 2011. My main focus has been mobile development and currently I'm a Senior iOS Developer for SumUp USA.

-----

I think the idea behind this blog is to share thoughts, ideas, stuff I investigate or I'm curious about but be not certain about it as I'm still trying to figure out what I'll be doing with this blog. If I do according to my initial expectations, the main focus will be mobile by exploring swift, kotlin and typescript. I expect to bring the IoT world to this place. Along with what I mentioned before, I will be sharing real life examples to try to inspire real life problems and be helpful somehow.

Hope you guys have fun, I most certainly will as I expect to learn from this experience too.

See you on the next post!
